# Test Plan: Vote Acceptance (#17)

## Automated Tests (StoriesController)

- [PASS] accept_estimate stores the submitted estimate value
- [PASS] accept_estimate stores a user-overridden estimate
- [PASS] accept_estimate marks story as estimated and clears votes
- [PASS] accept_estimate auto-advances to the next pending story
- [PASS] accept_estimate with no estimate param saves nil

## Manual Verification Required (requires browser)

- When all players have voted, a number input appears pre-filled with the highest Fibonacci vote
- The user can edit the number before clicking "Accept Estimate"
- Clicking the button saves the value shown in the input (not an average)
- The saved estimate appears in the Session Log

## Result: PASS (12/12 tests pass)
