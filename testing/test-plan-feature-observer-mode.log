# Test Plan: Observer Mode (#19)

## Automated Tests

### Model: GamesPlayer
- [PASS] voters scope excludes observers
- [PASS] observers scope returns only observers
- [PASS] players_all_voted? ignores observers
- [PASS] players_all_voted? returns false when a voter has not voted
- [PASS] players_all_voted? returns false when there are no voters
- [PASS] observer? returns true for an observer
- [PASS] observer? returns false for a voter

### Controller: GamesController
- [PASS] join as observer stores observer flag
- [PASS] join as voter stores observer false
- [PASS] observer cannot vote (returns 403 Forbidden)

Pre-existing failures (not related to this feature):
- test_should_get_index / new / show / edit — Bootstrap SCSS not compiled in test env (pre-existing)
- test_should_destroy_game — FK violation without dependent: :destroy (pre-existing)

## Manual Verification Required (requires browser)

- Observer joins via checkbox on join form — appears in Observers section of players table with badge
- Observers see real-time vote reveals and story changes
- Observer does NOT see voting form — sees "Observing" notice instead
- "All players voted" / "Accept Estimate" triggers correctly when only voters have voted (observer presence ignored)
- Removing an observer via the Remove link works

## Result: PASS (10/10 new tests pass)
