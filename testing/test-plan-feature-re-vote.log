# Test Plan: Re-vote / Discussion Round (#18)

## Automated Tests (StoriesController)

- [PASS] re-vote clears all player votes and keeps the active story

All existing stories controller tests continue to pass (11/11).

## Manual Verification Required (requires browser)

- When all players have voted, a "Re-vote" button appears on the current story card alongside "Accept Estimate"
- Clicking Re-vote clears all votes in real-time for all connected players
- The "Accept Estimate" / "Re-vote" buttons disappear after Re-vote (votes are nil)
- Players can vote again on the same story
- The active story does not change after clicking Re-vote

## Result: PASS (11/11 tests pass)
